                <p>Characters as symbols in any era and culture has always reflected more than just semantic meanings. <br>This project explores how the 21st century world can be expressed through type design. I drew inspiration from the textures of urban landscapes and the details of everyday life observed during walks in different cities to design various typefaces. The design of the journal incorporated visual languages usually found in computer operating and programming systems, to reflect the rational thinking and induction behind the seemingly organic and improvised designs.</p>

                <p>This is a presentation of my own conflicting thoughts about consumer culture and personal identity. <br>
                    I have had this debate going on in my head for years. On the one side is my desire to attain or pretend "a better self" through cyber shopping; on the other is my sanity that raises doubts against consumerism, trending aesthetics and influencer culture.</p>

                <a href="./designrelay.html"><p>03  Design Relay</p></a>
                <p>Design Relay is an experimental project that explores the contrasting ways in which humans and artificial intelligence understand and create graphic works. I selected 11 pieces from my own graphic portfolio—works that emphasize images over text. In this experiment, AI models and I alternate in interpreting these images and expanding them by adding new elements to the surrounding space. To achieve this, I utilized ChatGPT to analyze the images and generate descriptive prompts for outpainting, while Stable Diffusion, enhanced with a custom LoRA model for style transfer, was employed to create new visual extensions of the original works.</p>

                <a href="./climbingbodies.html"><p>04  Climbing Bodies</p></a>
                <p>Climbing Bodies is an interactive web application that utilizes pose detection to transform the shapes of the typeface in real-time, mirroring the climber's ever-changing postures.<br>
                    The idea of this project originated from my recent experience with bouldering. I felt that I was using my body in ways I have never experienced before. I draw a parallel between the climber's body on the wall and text on the page (screen). By capturing data from the climber's body movements to dynamically adapt the forms of a variable typeface, I aim to create a generative, dynamic and interactive reading experience. </p>

                <a href="./bugs.html"><p>05  [BUG!!] WARNING: ...</p></a>
                <p>This is a compilation of my research into the complicated issues surrounding "bug". To take it at surface value, a "bug" is a mistake. In more complicated situations, a "bug" might be a flaw in the system, something known to be wrong but hard to fix. <br>
                    The idea, unsurprisingly, originates from my own struggles when writing code. To solve a programming problem, one needs to construct their solution in mathematical terms. However, real-world situations aren't always as straightforward.</p>
